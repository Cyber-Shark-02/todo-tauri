Desktop To-Do List Application

A feature-rich and lightweight to-do list application for Windows, macOS, and Linux, built with modern web technologies and the Tauri framework.

Description

This isn't just another to-do list. This application was built to be a fast, reliable, and native-feeling desktop utility. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently, set deadlines with specific dates and times, and receive timely notifications with a countdown timer for urgent tasks. The app leverages the power of Tauri and Rust to provide a high-performance experience with a very small installation footprint.

Task Persistence: Your to-do list is automatically saved to your local machine, so you never lose your data.

Deadlines: Assign a specific date and time to each task.

Automatic Countdown Timer: For tasks due within the next 24 hours, a live countdown timer automatically appears to help you stay on track.

Cross-Platform: Built with Tauri, the application can be compiled for Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single codebase.
